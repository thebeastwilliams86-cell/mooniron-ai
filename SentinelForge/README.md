### Example Intelligence Report:
```
⚔️ SENTINEL INTELLIGENCE REPORT ⚔️

📊 Scanned: 237 files | Total: 1,456.3 MB

🧠 INTELLIGENT CATEGORIZATION:
   • Images: 89 files (456.2 MB) - 38%
   • Documents: 34 files (234.1 MB) - 14%
   • Temporary: 15 files (23.4 MB) - 6%

🔍 PATTERN DETECTION:
   ⚠️ Detected 8 potential duplicate patterns
   ⚠️ Inconsistent naming detected in 45 files

💡 INTELLIGENT RECOMMENDATIONS:
   1. 🟢 Clean 15 temporary files to free 23.4 MB (Confidence: 95%)
   2. 🟢 Organize 89 media files into type-specific folders (Confidence: 90%)
   3. 🟡 Compress 3 large files (567.2 MB) to save space (Confidence: 70%)

🎯 STRATEGIC INSIGHTS:
   • Images dominate (38%) - specialized organization recommended
   • High duplicate pattern count suggests manual review needed

## Safety Features

🔒 **All destructive actions require confirmation**
- Cleanup asks before deleting
- Defrag asks before running
- Organization asks before moving files

🔍 **Preview mode for all operations**
- See what will happen before it happens
- Dry-run capabilities for testing

📝 **Complete audit trail**
- All actions logged with timestamps
- View history in Logs tab

## Configuration

Settings are stored in `sentinel_config.json`:

```json
{
  "monitored_folders": [],
  "scan_interval": 300,
  "auto_cleanup_threshold_gb": 5.0,
  "enable_auto_actions": false,
  "openai_model": "gpt-4o-mini",
  "archive_extensions": [".tmp", ".bak", ".old", ".cache"],
  "cleanup_age_days": 30
}
```

## How the Intelligence Engine Works

The Sentinel Intelligence Engine uses:

1. **Pattern Recognition**: Analyzes file names for semantic meaning
2. **Multi-Factor Scoring**: Combines extension analysis with keyword detection
3. **Statistical Learning**: Detects patterns across your file collection
4. **Confidence Algorithms**: Scores recommendations based on multiple factors
5. **Strategic Analysis**: Provides long-term insights, not just immediate actions

Everything runs **locally on your machine** - no data leaves your computer!

## Platform Compatibility

**Windows**: Full features including defragmentation
**Linux**: All features except Windows-specific defrag (gracefully disabled)

## Logs

Daily logs stored in `logs/` directory:
- `sentinel_YYYYMMDD.log`
- Mythic-themed event messages
- Error tracking and debugging info

## Mythic Theme

The Sentinel speaks in mythical language:
- "The Sentinel's gaze sweeps across /path/to/folder"
- "The Archive is purged. 3.2 GB of echoes fade into void."
- "The Blade is reforged. Fragmentation reduced."
- "Files find their place in the grand tapestry."

## Troubleshooting

**GUI doesn't appear**: Ensure tkinter is installed
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install python3-tk

# macOS (included with Python)
# Windows (included with Python)
```

**Defrag not working**: Only available on Windows
- On Linux, this feature is automatically disabled

**Want even smarter analysis?**: The Sentinel learns from patterns
- Analyzes more files for better pattern detection
- Recognizes project-specific naming conventions
- Adapts recommendations to your folder structure
